Our team (Team three) received Team nine’s project. Team nine’s battleship game was a console-based game written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS programming languages. 
We believe that this Team has used the functional paradigm. 
Their project relates most with the functional design paradigm because it will start when the user gives data for the program to use and everything is contained within 
many separate functions that are not attached to any classes.
In addition, they have multiple functions that interact with one another. An example of this can be seen in their project is having their function against local player and 
against bot java script files call another function named grid load to be able to pull up the different playing grids for each player when it is their turn and is able to 
store the players or computers ship placements as well as the hits and misses. A similar approach is implemented when the player first picks how many ships they want and the game mode 
the player would like to play which calls a function named game mode config that configures the variables for the game counters and win condition and removes the configuration buttons to 
load the selection screen. By using an functional design paradigm functions were the main source of communicaion between eachother such as functions calling functions.
This design paradigm made sense for the team to use as it better suits functional languages like JavaScript.
